### 36-5 Testing with Jest and Node

* Completed Step 0 - Step 2 of assignment directions
*
* Created test file for markov.js
* Wrote separate tests for makeChains and makeText instance methods
* wrote separate test for getRandomWord class method
*
* after "git clone", will need to "npm install" to create node_modules structure
*
* Command Line entries used for testing:
* "node makeText.js file eggs.txt"
* "node makeText.js url http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt"
*
* This is the first time I felt really confident about writing tests, so am anxious to apply that to python now.
*
* This was fun!
